### How to Use

1. **Go to** [Calculator](/calculator)
2. **Enter**:
   - **Account Balance**: Total trading capital (e.g., $10,000)
   - **Risk per Trade**: % you're willing to risk (e.g., 2%)
   - **Entry Price**: Where you'll enter (from analysis)
   - **Stop Loss**: Where you'll exit if wrong (from analysis)
3. **Click "Calculate"**
4. **Results show**:
   - **Position Size**: How many units/coins to buy
   - **Dollar Risk**: How much $ you're risking
   - **Stop Loss Distance**: % between entry and stop

### Example

**Setup**:
- Account: $10,000
- Risk: 2% ($200)
- Entry: $43,000 (BTC)
- Stop Loss: $42,000

**Results**:
- Position Size: **0.2 BTC** (worth $8,600)
- Dollar Risk: $200
- SL Distance: 2.33%

**What this means**: Buy 0.2 BTC at $43k. If it drops to $42k, you lose $200 (2% of account).

## ⚠️ Risk Management Tips

### Golden Rules

1. **Never risk more than 1-3% per trade**
   - Protects you from big losses
   - Allows you to survive losing streaks

2. **Always use stop losses**
   - No exceptions
   - Set it and leave it (don't move it)

3. **Don't overtrade**
   - Quality > quantity
   - 1-3 good trades per week is enough

4. **Start small**
   - Test strategies with small size
   - Increase as you gain confidence

5. **Keep a journal**
   - Track every trade (entry, exit, reason, emotion)
   - Review monthly to improve

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**  
→ Wait for your setup, don't chase every signal

❌ **Revenge Trading**  
→ After a loss, take a break instead of forcing trades

❌ **Moving Stop Loss**  
→ Accept the loss, don't widen your stop

❌ **Over-leveraging**  
→ High leverage = high risk of liquidation

❌ **Ignoring Risk/Reward**  
→ Only take trades with R:R of 1:2 or better
